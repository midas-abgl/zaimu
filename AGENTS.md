# Scrollbars

Scrollbars must remain contained within their own scrollable div. Inset vertical and horizontal tracks and thumbs before every edge so they do not cross rounded corners or render outside the container. `ScrollArea` roots must clip overflow. On touch platforms, hide native scrollbar overlays when they cannot honor those bounds; use `ScrollArea` for a visible contained track.
